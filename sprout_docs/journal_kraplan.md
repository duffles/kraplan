* Kraplan

 - alienating hand gestures
 - expectation of understanding is alienating without information (TV
   crew example)
 - "I'm in the lead?"
 - How should we lead this?  Make explicit.
 - website as extra structure/context?
 - when interacting with a group, have a clear goal in mind
 - tagging out
 - mindset change: work on shit you suck at
 - don't do your version of complaining
 - lack of confidence v. lack of skill in group making do thinging?
 - explicitly condescending toward carmen, but I don't think she got it?
 - totally competent at being incompetent: needed to articulate the
   opportunity for a learning experience
 - communicate ideas directly without fear of alienation
 - lack of long term articulation is not necessarily a problem
 - contextualize communication as education
 - full engagement, keep it a priority
 - 


** High level content for site
*** Two themes								 :nagle:
    - preservation of status quo
    - Dweck's intelligence/praise dichotomy

*** Collecting factoids that are surprising
*** Poor people = more testing
*** "Did you know. . .?" re: Kraplan
*** Focus: what audience do we have?  What do we want to persuade them of?
*** Choosing our method
What and how do we want to communicate?  Emotionally?  By facts?  The
facts only approach has problems. . . c.f. Fairtest.
*** Audiences
    - kids in high school
    - kids in college
    - teachers
    - PTA board members
    - school reformers
    - politicians
    - journalists
    - parents
    - college administrations

*** What is our message?
We're looking for an entry point; this means that we need to choose
the battle carefully and define the terms to alienate as few as people
as possible, initially.

 - Alec's explanation of not being anti-testing, but just being
   anti-Kaplan, was unclear.
 - Good point: take for granted education as good, indict Kaplan's perversion.
 - Emotional appeals don't preclude fact-based approaches
   (c.f. Carmen's work)
 - blackpeopleloveus.com
 - We don't need to use kraplan
 - Use kraplan as a bridge between the choir and the people who are
   uncomfortable with testing
 - Kraplan's PR campaign
 - Play off the dissonance between mainstream perception and truth
 - Use Kaplan as an entry point to the narrative of corrupted testing,
   as opposed to trying to fight ideological battles in a public space
 - Lack of feedback in testing (nagle)
 - kaplan fulfills a need they define
